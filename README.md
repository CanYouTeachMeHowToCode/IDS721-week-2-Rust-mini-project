# IDS721 Weekly Rust Mini Project

## Week 2

A Basic Calculater that supports plus('+'), minus('-'), multiply('*') and division('/') (will round down to nearest integer). Unfortunately, it currently does not support computations with parentheses ('('). 

### Usage
> Run `cargo run -- basic-calculator -i [expr]` to get the value of the final result of expression `expr` after evaluation. `expr` is `String` type; e.g. the output of running command `cargo run -- basic-calculator -i "2*2+3*4"` is 
`16`, since $ 2 \times 2 + 3 \times 4 = 4 + 12 = 16$ by doing some quick math.
